### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Project Portfolio 

#### startup-success
- Supervised learning approach to predicting if a startup company will go under.
- EDA and attribute processing were followed by various machine learning algorithms, with random forest producing the best results. 

#### discord-foodbot
- Python-based implementation of a chat server bot built on the discord.py API.
- Performs various functions on a cooking-themed server, including:
  - Web scraping using Beautiful Soup to return cleaned ingredient lists and instructions when prompted with a dish.
  - Returns the FDA recommended internal temperature when prompted with a meat-based dish.
  - Prediction of milk quality utilizing a trained ensemble model.
  - Various administrative roles.

#### news-article-classification
- Unsupervised learning assessment of text documents in the form of BBC news articles. 
- Utilizes non-negative matrix factorization to obtain top keywords associated with each cluster.
- Implementation of a predictive model based on the fitted NMF matricies.

#### heart-disease-prediction
- Supervised learning project that predicts risk of coronary heart disease based on common patient medical attributes.
- Data cleaning and imputation to prepare for various models, including naÃ¯ve Bayes, linear regression, and multiple ensemble approaches. 
- Early machine learning project that includes a writeup on the findings.

#### bio-ml/pyzyme
- Python tool built for biology researchers to calculate and plot IC50 based on experimental data. 
- IC50 is a measure of the concentration at which a drug inhibits a biological function by half, which is commonly used to assess the efficacy of a drug.
